# DnnC YouTubLibrary

The DnnC YouTube Library makes it a breeze to build a library of YouTube videos for you DnnCMS website.

Fully template you can customize the look and feel of the module to fit with your own website. The template editing system uses CodeMirror for code tag coloring making it easy to edit the templates and Css.

The DnnC YouTube Library makes it easy to manage your videos with ‘drag and drop’ functionality to easily change the display order of you videos.

Adding a video to your library is also very easy, just copy the YouTube video ID, paste it into the input box and click ‘Retrieve video data’ then the module does the rest, by importing all the video data including the title, description, even a thumb of the video for you. When the data is imported you can then change the information about the video easily and save!

No more copying and pasting the embed code of your YouTube videos into a Text/Html module!
